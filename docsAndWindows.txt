Document Object and Window Object

In web programming, especially when working with JavaScript, you will come across two crucial concepts: 
the Document Object and the Window Object. These two objects are the backbone of the Document Object Model (DOM), 
which is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document and allows a way 
to manipulate its content and layout.

The Window Object:

The Window Object is the top-level object in the browser Object hierarchy. It represents an open window 
in a browser and holds global variables, global functions, location, history, and screen. When a webpage 
is loaded into a browser, a new window object is automatically created.

The Window Object provides numerous methods and properties to interact with the browser window. 
These include methods to open/close a window, to show prompts, alerts, or confirmations, to navigate between 
tabs, and many more. The Window Object is also the global object for JavaScript, meaning all global variables 
and functions become properties and methods of the window.

The Document Object:

The Document Object, on the other hand, is a part of the Window Object. It represents any web page 
loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content. 

The Document Object allows you to manipulate everything inside a webpage, i.e., HTML elements, 
attributes, events, and styles. You can create, delete, change, and add HTML elements & attributes, change 
CSS styles, and react to HTML events. Basically, the Document Object is the owner of all other objects in your web page.

The Difference:

While both objects are part of the DOM and are interconnected, they serve different purposes 
and offer different functionalities.

The Window Object is the overall representation of a browser window and includes everything from the document, 
buttons, and address bar, to the current URL. It deals more with the browser's components and behavior, such 
as the user's screen size, scrolling, and URL changes.

In contrast, the Document Object is more concerned with the content of the webpage displayed in that browser 
window. It allows developers to create, read, update and delete the elements and content within the HTML document.

Put simply, the Window Object is like a container that includes the Document Object among other objects, 
whereas the Document Object represents the content of a webpage.

In conclusion, understanding the difference between these two objects is fundamental to manipulating the 
browser and the DOM effectively. Knowing when and how to use the Window Object and Document Object will 
allow you to create more interactive and dynamic web pages.
